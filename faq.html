			<p><b>What does (alpha) after CFBTracker.com mean?</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				An alpha build of a product or website is a very early version that&#8217;s likely to have more bugs, issues, and improvements to come than that of a truly finished and polished product. While great pride is taken in the effort given to build and present to you CFBTracker.com, to be perfectly candid, the large majority of it was built by a novice developer who ever so graciously received some help from more senior coders. Still, a novice is managing the site and learning as he goes, so you can expect to see bugs crop up and we will do our best to fix them as quickly as possible.</p>
			<p>
			<p><b>What is CFBTracker.com?</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				CFBTracker.com is a site designed to allow college football fans to follow their favorite team&#8217;s quest to finish the season ranked in the Top 4 teams, which would earn them a birth in the College Football Playoff and a chance to win the National Championship.</p></p>
			<p><b>What was the inspirtation for CFBTracker.com?</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				Last year, I created a thread on the premium message boards for Aggie football, TexAgs.com (if you&#8217;re an Aggie fan and NOT a subscriber there, you are missing out!). This thread was one that, game to game week to week for all teams across the nation, I tracked the Texas A&amp;M Aggie football season (assuming we'd win out following our Week 3 loss to Alabama) to see what scenarios (who do we need to lose, what games presented the best chances of that, etc.) would allow the Ags a berth into the National Championship game. I had a ton of fun with my fellow TexAgs buddies in dissecting each game and all of the scenarios, and I wanted to do it again this year, but make it automated; less work by hand. In doing so, and with the change to a 4 team playoff system, I figured I may as well include the Top 24 teams (because the Top 25 would not fit well on the homepage!) and track them all week to week.</p></p>
			<p><p><b>What unique information does CFBTracker.com provide the fan?</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				While it is always critical to follow your favorite team's schedule to know wins, losses, future games, and thus their potential for a berth in the in the College Football Playoff, more often than not there is more to consider than just their schedule.
				<br>
				<br>
				What about who is ranked above your team, who those teams play, and the games they will play with the greatest potential for them to lose, allowing your team to move up in the rankings? CFBTracker.com will show you that.
				<br>
				<br>
				What about being able to look back and see which games helped catapult your team into the Top 4 at the end of the season? CFBTracker.com will show you that as well.</p></p>
